# README

This is a web application that I am working on as a final project for Tech Talent South's Code Immersion course. The application is a book-focused social media site in the style of Goodreads and Twitter. Users can create their own booklists, create posts, follow other users, and discuss their books with other users. The site is built with the Ruby on Rails framework.

Things to take note of if you are interested in cloning or forking this:

* Ruby version 2.5.1

* Rails version 5.2.1

* If you do not already have Ruby and Rails on your system, see the following links for instructions for your operating system:
	* RVM: https://rvm.io/rvm/install
	* Ruby: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
	* Rails: https://installrails.com/

* You can seed the database with fake content in order to get aquainted with how it works. To do this, in your terminal, navigate into the directory of the project and run the commands "rails db:migrate" and "rails db: seed". 

* To view the application, in the project directory run "rails s" and go to localhost:3000 in your web browser.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
